# Mappings Guide

Each state requires its own folder under `pipeline/mappings/{STATE}/` containing the files described below. These files tell the pipeline how to translate the raw provider data for that state into a standardized format that the rest of the pipeline can work with.

All string values across all mapping files are stored **lowercased and stripped** of whitespace unless noted otherwise.

---

## Mapping Files

### `col_map.csv`

Maps each raw column name found in a provider's CSV to the pipeline's standardized column name.

- Format: `{raw column name : standardized column name}`
- Used by `standardize.py` to rename incoming columns before processing

---

### `raw_col_lists.csv`

Stores all known raw column name variants that correspond to each standardized column name. Used as a broader fallback when a direct `col_map.csv` match is not found.

- Format: `{standardized col name : [raw col 1, raw col 2, ...]}`

---

### `county_map.csv`

Maps each raw county name (as it appears in provider data) to the pipeline's standardized county name for that state.

- Format: `{raw county name : standardized county name}`
- Used by `standardize.py` to normalize county names across providers

---

### `master_county_list.txt`

The canonical list of county names used by the pipeline as the authoritative reference for a given state. Every county that should appear in the output must be in this list.

- Format: `[A County, B County, ...]`
- Names may be stored capitalized with a `" County"` suffix — the pipeline lowercases them and strips the suffix when building the standardized name

---

### `raw_county_list.txt`

A flat list of all raw county name variants seen in the source data for this state. Serves as a reference when building or auditing `county_map.csv`.

- Format: one raw county name per line, lowercased and stripped

---

### `raw_col_names.txt`

An intermediate scratch file listing all raw column names observed in a state's provider CSVs. Use this as a reference when manually populating `col_map.csv` and `raw_col_lists.csv` for a new state.

- Format: one raw column name per line, lowercased and stripped

---

## Adding Mappings for a New State

1. Create a folder at `pipeline/mappings/{STATE}/` using the two-letter uppercase state code (e.g. `GA/`)
2. Collect raw CSV samples from each provider for that state
3. Use the raw column names to populate `raw_col_names.txt`, then build `col_map.csv` and `raw_col_lists.csv`
4. Use the raw county names to populate `raw_county_list.txt`, then build `county_map.csv` and `master_county_list.txt`
5. Verify by running `python main.py {state} --dry-run` and checking the output for missing or NaN counties
